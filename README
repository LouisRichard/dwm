Dependencies

gcc
libx11-dev
libxft-dev
libxinerama-dev
xorg
fonts-font-awesome

If you are using a discreet GPU, make sure to install the necessary drivers beforehand 
(looking at you nVidia)

My install includes the following :
dwm/dwm     - Dynamic window manager (this repo, no need to download it)
st/st       - simple terminal
tools/dmenu - dynamic menu
tools/slock - x display locker, recommended if you wanna lock your screen in an office environment

all available with wget on https://dl.suckless.org/

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm

But I, ofc, have a .xinitrc in this repo you can take if you want to.
It is currently optimised for my laptop with a battery indicator and all.
A desktop version will come.
If you want to use mine, juste copy or move it to your home directory and remove the `.laptop` or `.desktop` from the filename.
IE : mv .xinitrc.laptop ~/.xinitrc

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
